## Try
As kids, we were told a story called the Spider and the King emphasizing the virtues of patience and perseverance. The story went like, once upon a time, there was king who had lost his kingdom to an enemy nation, he escaped to a cave with his army. There he saw a spider repeatedly trying to build a web, failing, but not giving up. The spider persevered and eventually succeeded in building the web. Inspired by it, the king  took up the challenge to regain his kingdom and eventually after many failed attempts succeeded.

This is a nice story to hear and many of us might remember it too. But let me ask you this, what does it mean to try?

To a spider the only reality we know of is that of its ability to make a web and catch its prey. To it, its fate, it is inevitably destined to make a web or perish. 

Ok that maybe of an insect, but what of the king? To which, I'd answer: Who is a king; without a kingdom? 

Is it even possible to call him a king if the kingdom didn't exist. In fact, the story makes sense so easily I'd say for this reason. 

What I'm trying to articulate is that for a spider or the king such is life (c'est la vie) there is no choice given to a spider to not be a spider and so is the same to a king. So, let me ask you again, what do you mean by try?

## Try

Another perspective I want you to ponder with the word "Try" is the saying "Practice makes perfect." This saying is incomplete. Ironically it is derived from "Practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect." 

So what does it mean to do perfect practice?

Its quite simple actually according to me, just like the story of the spider and the king, the spider being the spider makes it perfect. 

This brings to us an answer but with it many questions too i.e. you just need to perfect the art of being yourself, the rest is taken care of. 

But what does being yourself mean? 

I initially thought of quoting some works for this, but I'll put my own thoughts in a word or two. 

Being yourself is state of flow where you are absolutely present in the moment. The moment has neither a beginning nor an end. A state where every action is complete in itself.

[P.S. I think I wrote the above lines way too succintely, I'll elaborate on it more someday]

## Try till you succeed
What is success? I don't really have a clue, but this poem by [Qamar Jalalbadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Jalalabadi) is intriguing. I'd give it a listen first. [Uske baad kya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZLAqpDWhMI). (Opinion: Recital > Text > Translation)

Urdu verse:

कर लूँगा जमा दौलत-ओ-ज़र, उसके बाद क्या?

ले लूँगा एक शानदार सा घर, उसके बाद क्या?

मय की तलब जो होगी तो बन जाऊँगा मैं रिंद,

कर लूँगा मयकदों का सफ़र, उसके बाद क्या?

होगा जो शौक़ हुस्न से राज़-ओ-नियाज़ का,

कर लूँगा गेसुओं में सहर, उसके बाद क्या?

शेर-ओ-सुख़न की खूब सजाऊँगा महफ़िलें,

दुनिया में होगा नाम, मगर उसके बाद क्या?

मौज आएगी तो सारे जहाँ की करूँगा सैर,

वापस वही पुराना नगर, उसके बाद क्या?

इक रोज़ मौत ज़ीस्त का दर खटखटाएगी,

बुझ जाएगा ‘चिराग़-ओ-क़मर’, उसके बाद क्या?

उठी थी ख़ाक, ख़ाक से मिल जाएगी वहीं,

फिर उसके बाद किसको ख़बर, उसके बाद क्या?

Translation:

I will accumulate wealth and riches — but then what?

I will buy myself a grand, luxurious home — but then what?

If I crave wine, I’ll become a carefree drunkard,

I’ll wander from tavern to tavern — but then what?

If I’m drawn toward beauty and romantic whispers,

I’ll lose myself in flowing tresses at dawn — but then what?

I’ll grace poetic gatherings with eloquence and verse,

My name will echo in the world — but then what?

In a wave of joy, I’ll travel the entire world,

But in the end, I’ll return to my old town — and then what?

One day, death will knock at the door of life,

The lamp of Qamar (the poet) will be extinguished — and then what?

I rose from dust, and to dust I shall return,

After that, who knows what comes? — what then?
